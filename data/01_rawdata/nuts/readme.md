NUTS region shapefiles go here. We used the 10M resolution shapefiles. If you decide to use a different resolution, you must update all RASTERPROCESSING scripts.

Shapefile polygons delineating the European NUTS regions are available from EuroStat at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/statistical-units/territorial-units-statistics.
