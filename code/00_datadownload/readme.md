We used the scripts in `code/00_datadownload` to download hourly daily temperature and UTCI from Copernicus and aggregate to daily rasters. 
These scripts are adapted from Copernicus's API instructions. In these scripts, we compute the daily min, mean, and max temperature or UTCI for a given raster cell.

You must register for an API personal acccess token to download the data. Instructions for getting a API personal access token and using the Copernicus API are [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api__;!!Mak6IKo!NF7C0T1oSYoCV5IaxiDeQKN_C96cNuxWwqGgV2n7aV6U_zUVuumtmBS7tSRKQqBULAdt7mXAT2H3OmoSpX8fqZCg1kVrHQ$).
